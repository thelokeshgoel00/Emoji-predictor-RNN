# Emoji-predictor-RNN
## Introduction
In this I have tried to predict emojis based on the text.<br>
For example while in a conversation, emojis are often shown on GBoard based on context of conversation. <br>
I have tried to replicate a model based on the same<br>
For That I have used Recurrent Neural network and Glove Embeddings
## Datasets
The dataset I used is quite a small one and is provided inside. <br>
However We alse need glove.6B.50d.txt embeddings which can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/watts2/glove6b50dtxt <br>
Please update the path to these embeddings inside the code
## Requirements
- Python3
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Emoji
- Tensorflow (v2)
